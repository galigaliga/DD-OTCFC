This project releases a model for multi-energy load forecasting in integrated energy systems: FESTRNN.
The repository is organized as follows:  

data/              # Contains the dataset for training and testing.  

layers/            # Contains custom model layers.  

test_model/        # Contains the FESTRNN and Some of the latest comparison models.  

get_config.py      # Script for managing configurations and parameters.  

main.py            # The main script to run the project.  

metrics.py         # Defines evaluation metrics.  

trainer.py         # Handles the model training and evaluation loop.  

util.py            # Utility functions.
